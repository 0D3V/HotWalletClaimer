# Near Protocol: Herewallet Hot Auto-Claim Bot

This Python script simplifies claiming the cryptocurrency HOT, using the "HereWalletBot" app, a free-to-use application on Telegram that is also Web3 enabled on the NEAR Protocol blockchain. The app requires frequent logins to claim tokens to maximize accumulating the most rewards. This script automates these actions, guaranteeing the maximum accumulation of HOT tokens by executing the claim sequence once the wallet is full. Should the wallet not be filled, it estimates the time until completion and waits to claim, thus optimizing both network usage and lowering your Gas Fees.

üí° **TIP:** You can claim on multiple HereWallet accounts using a single Telegram account, provided you use an individual session for each account using SCREEN or an alternative, as described below. Each time you scan a QR Code or enter a One-Time Password (OTP), it counts as one login attempt. Attempting to log into a single Telegram account more than 20 times in 24 hours is considered "flooding" by Telegram, and they will apply a 24-hour cooldown on further login attempts. However, once logged in, you will stay logged in unless you exit the script.

## üöÄ How To Use (installation based on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04)

### Linux Users - Quick Start (or follow the manual steps below)
#### Install GitHub (if necessary), fetch this repository, run the install script!

- VPS users should make an SSH connection via PuTTy or open the Command Window on your local machine.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git || true && git clone https://github.com/thebrumby/HotWalletBot.git && cd HotWalletBot && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```
Start your first session with ```screen -S first_session```. If you are not in the HotWalletBot directory, you must ```cd HotWalletBot```. Execute the Python script using ```python3 claim.py```, then follow the [Usage Notes](#usage-notes) to set up the session and automate the claiming process. Pressing ```CTRL+A+D``` simultaneously will leave this session running in the background. ```screen -r first_session``` will resume the session for you to check on progress, or for errors. 

If you have a second account, from the command line (not within the first Screen), start another session with ```screen -S second_session``` and execute the Python script ```python3 claim.py```. You may now run another instance of ```python3 claim.py``` to log into the second account. You can exit Screen and leave the script unattended by pressing ```CTRL+A+D```. ```screen -r second_session``` will resume the session for you to check on progress, or for errors. 

üí° Tip: Each screen session consumes approximately 450 MB of server memory. The total number of sessions you can run is limited by your server's physical RAM. To maximize usage, you can add sessions up to the point where memory is nearly utilized. Executing ```sudo reboot``` clears all active sessions and releases memory once the operating system reboots, providing a quick way to refresh your system resources.

## Usage Instructions

#### After executing the script with python3 claim.py, the process flow is as follows:

1. **Force Claim on First Run:** Enter `y` to force a claim even if the wallet isn't full; otherwise, simply press `<Enter>` to skip.
2. **Enable Debugging:** Type `y` to activate debugging, which saves process screenshots for review. Press `<Enter>` to keep debugging off (default).
3. **QR Code Login Option:** Want to log in by scanning a QR code? Press `<Enter>`, or type `n` to proceed with your phone number and OTP.
4. **Session Name Configuration:**
   - Press `<Enter>` to assign a default session name of ascending numeric values (1, 2, 3, etc.).
   - Alternatively, you can enter your value (JohnDoes_Wallet, myWallet1, etc).
   - If restarting the script after stopping it, you may want to re-use a previous Session Name to keep the screenshots in the same location.
5. **Country Name for Telegram:**
   - Input your Country Name exactly as listed on [Telegram's login page](https://web.telegram.org/k/), like "USA" or "UNITED KINGDOM".
   - As a shortcut, pressing `<Enter>` attempts to select the corresponding Country Name based on your internet connection IP address.
   - If your IP address location differs from your registered phone number location, you MUST specify it explicitly. 
6. **Phone Number Entry:** Omit the initial "0" from your phone number when prompted.
7. **One-Time Password (OTP)**: Enter the One-Time Password that has been sent to your Telegram Messaging Account.
8. **Seed Phrase Input for HereWallet Login:** Your seed phrase remains private, with script transparency ensuring security. Ensure your phrase consists of exactly 12 words, spaced correctly without punctuation or numbers.

After following these steps, if all inputs are correctly entered, and assuming no flooding block is in place, you'll successfully logged into both Telegram and HereWallet.

## Inspiration and Enhancement

This project was inspired by [vannszs/HotWalletBot](https://github.com/vannszs/HotWalletBot.git). The code in this repository has been rewritten, not only to fix the bugs and make it more robust but also to extend the original options.

# Security Considerations for HotWalletClaimer Usage

The HotWalletClaimer script allows users to automate interactions with the "Claim Hot" game. 

‚ö†Ô∏è HTTPS Communication: All interactions with the Telegram Web App occur over HTTPS, providing a secure channel.

‚ö†Ô∏è Your seed phrase and Telegram login details are not stored or transmitted by this script, except during the necessary one-time login process on https://web.telegram.org/k/#@herewalletbot. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging: Enabling debug mode captures the whole process as screenshots, excluding the seed phrase entry step. These images are stored locally to assist you in the event of errors and are not otherwise transmitted or uploaded in any way.

## Security Considerations:

üí° Private Devices: Only use this script on private, secure machines or Virtual Private Servers that only you have access to.

üí° Caution with Seed Phrases: Be very cautious with accounts of significant value. Consider the effect of any unintended loss should your seed phrase become compromissed.

üí° Awareness and Discretion: Understand the security trade-offs involved in using this automation tool or any other third-party tools. Your vigilance is crucial in safeguarding your information.

## Disclaimer:
The use of HotWalletClaimer is entirely at your own risk.
