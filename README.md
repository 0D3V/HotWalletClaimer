# Hot Wallet Auto-Claim Bot

This Python script automates the process of claiming HOT tokens from the Herewallet app, which operates on the Near Protocol. Within the first 40 days of its release, the Mine Hot app reportedly gained 3 million users, allowing them to mine HOT tokens that are stored on the Near Blockchain. Users are required to log in every few hours to mine or claim tokens. This script simplifies the task, especially for those with multiple accounts, by cycling through 12-word seed phrases, logging into each wallet, and claiming tokens when the wallet is full. If a wallet is not ready for claiming, the script retrieves the time until it is filled and waits before trying again, reducing unnecessary network traffic.

Note: This game/app has already caused various overloads to both Near Protocol and the provider's CDN.
If the system throws a lot of errors, you may need to leave it some time before retrying.
I will attempt to keep this repository updated should the game creators update their code.

Note: You have two options to integrate your accounts:
1) Create a seed.txt file in the same directory as claim.py
2) Run claim.py and you will be prompted to enter the seed phrase. It will check you entered 12 words and create seeds.txt

Each seed phrase should be the 12 words, each separated by a space.
As mentioned earlier, you may enter more than one seed phrase, with each on a separate line.
