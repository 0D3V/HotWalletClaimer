# Near Protocol: HereWallet "HOT" Token Claim Assistant

This Python script aids in mining (claiming) the cryptocurrency "HOT" through the "HereWalletBot", a free-to-use, Telegram-based Web3-enabled app operating on the NEAR Protocol blockchain. To maximize rewards, users need to frequently visit the app to claim tokens. The script automates this process by initiating a claim at a random interval close to when the wallet is full. If the wallet isn't yet filled, it calculates the time until completion and waits for the optimal moment‚Äîadjusted by your preferred random offset‚Äîto claim, thereby minimizing network load and reducing gas fees.

‚òï If you find this script useful, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HotWallletBot) as a token of appreciation. Thank you in advance for any support!  ‚òï

üîç **HINT:** Although you cannot register multiple wallets to a single Telegram account, this script enables you to manage multiple pre-existing HereWallet accounts with just one Telegram login by handling each Wallet in a separate virtual browser session. Alternatively, you can manage each Wallet with its own Telegram login if preferred.

üí° **PRO-TIP:** For a straightforward, easily visualized, unattended claim process, novice users may find [SCREEN](#screen) a helpful tool. Alternatively, more confident Linux users will benefit from the additional features provided by the [PM2](#pm2) process manager.

#### Quick Start Installation (based on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04):
Copy and paste the Quick Start command block into your terminal (or follow the [Manual Steps](#manual-steps) below if you prefer).

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git || true && git clone https://github.com/thebrumby/HotWalletBot.git && cd HotWalletBot && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```
<a name="screen"></a>
## Use of ```SCREEN``` to Manage Unattended Claim Sessions<br>(Sessions are lost after reboot)
- **Starting Your First Session:**
  - If you are not in the HotWalletBot directory, navigate there first with `cd HotWalletBot`.
  - Start your first independent session with `screen -S first_session`. 
  - Execute the script with `python3 claim.py` and follow the [Usage Notes](#usage-notes) to set up the session.
  - Detach from the screen session and keep it running in the background by pressing `CTRL+A+D`.
  - To resume the session and check progress or for errors, use `screen -r first_session`.
  - To resume a previously set-up session use the command `python3 claim.py Wallet1`. Remember, 'Wallet1' is the default session name. If you've used a different name, replace 'Wallet1' with your actual session name.

- **Starting a Second Account Session:**
  - From the command line (outside the first screen session), ensure you are in the HotWalletBot directory with `cd HotWalletBot` and start a second session with `screen -S second_session` and execute `python3 claim.py`.
  - Detach from this second screen session by pressing `CTRL+A+D`.
  - To resume the session and check progress or for errors, use `screen -r second_session`.
  - To resume a previously set-up session use the command `python3 claim.py Wallet2`. Remember, 'Wallet2' is the default session name. If you've used a different name, replace 'Wallet2' with your actual session name.

üíª **TIP:** Each session while in wait status uses around 30mb of memory and virtually no CPU load. During the Claim or Login phases, however, each session requires approximately 450 MB of memory and utilizes a larger portion of your CPU resources. The concurrent claims setting (default value 1) limits the number of active claims to prevent hardware overload. Assess your hardware's capacity to determine how many simultaneous sessions it can handle, and adjust the maximum number accordingly by following the [Usage Notes](#usage-notes). Even with a maximum of one allowed claim session, claiming on multiple wallets is easily possible; additional claims just queue until a claim session slot becomes available.

## Use of ```PM2``` to Execute Unattended Claim Sessions (Persist After Reboot)

- **Installation:**
  - Install PM2 manually, or use the install script packaged in the HotWalletBot directory. Navigate to the HotWalletBot directory if not already there:
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x install_pm2.sh && sudo ./install_pm2.sh
    ```

- **Setup Before Using PM2:**
  - Open the script using `python3 claim.py` and complete the setup for each wallet. Follow the process to log into Telegram and enter your seed phrase. After setup, you will be prompted whether to exit before moving on to the claim function. Choose 'n' to exit the script and resume the session with PM2, or 'a' to automatically add the session name as a PM2 session.

- **Configure PM2 to start automatically on boot/reboot:**
  - **Linux/Ubuntu:**
    - For dedicated Linux/Ubuntu machines, initialize PM2 with systemd to ensure it starts on boot:
      ```bash
      pm2 startup systemd
      ```
      If the active user lacks administrative privileges, PM2 will provide a command to execute with sudo to complete the systemd activation.
  - **Windows:**
    - For setups that require persistent reboots, please refer to the Windows Installation Guide provided below.

- **Adding Sessions to PM2:**
  - If you choose to manually add then PM2 session, rather than have 'claim.py' add it, you can use the command below. This example starts a session named `firstWallet` which loads a previously saved `claim.py` session named `Wallet1`:

    ```bash
    pm2 start claim.py --name firstWallet -- Wallet1
    ```
    Note: Replace `Wallet1` with the actual Session name given during setup if different.

- **Manage PM2 Sessions:**
  - Save configuration to persist through reboots:
    ```bash
    pm2 save
    ```
  - View all PM2 managed processes:
    ```bash
    pm2 list
    ```
  - View logs for a specific session (e.g., `firstWallet`):
    ```bash
    pm2 log firstWallet
    ```
  - To remove a managed wallet:
    ```bash
    pm2 delete firstWallet
    ```
  - To stop PM2 from starting on boot:
    ```bash
    pm2 unstartup systemd
    ```

## V2.0.3 Release Notes - Option to save Telegram log in. 

## Usage Instructions
After executing the script with `python3 claim.py`, you will be prompted to update settings and configure the session:

1. **Update Settings:**
   - If you choose "yes" when prompted, you will review and possibly update the following settings:
      - `forceClaim`: Choose to force a claim the first time the script runs, regardless of whether the wallet is full.
      - `debugIsOn`: Activate debugging to save screenshots locally; default is off.
      - `hideSensitiveInput`: Ensures sensitive information like phone numbers and seed phrases remain hidden; default is ON.
      - `screenshotQRCode`: Prefer to log in via QR code; the alternative is manual login via phone number and OTP.
      - `maxSessions`: Set the maximum number of concurrent claim sessions; additional wallets will wait for an available slot.
      - `verboseLevel`: Adjust the verbosity of console messages; options range from 1 (minimal) to 3 (all messages).
      - `forceNewSession`: Forces a new login, useful if the existing session encounters errors.
      - `lowestClaimOffset` and `highestClaimOffset`: Define the range for randomized claim timing relative to when the pot is filled.
         - **Examples of Claim Timing:**
            - `-30, -15`: Early claims 30 to 15 minutes before the pot is full.
            - `30, 60`: Late claims 30 minutes to 1 hour after the pot is full.
            - `-15, 15`: Random claims within a 15-minute window around the pot being filled.

2. **Session Name Configuration:**
   - Sessions are auto-named numerically or can be customized. Reusing a name attempts to resume that session.

3. **Login Options:**
     - If the script detects you have a saved Telegram session, you can choose 'y' when prompted to continue with it and proceed directly to step 7. 
     - If you prefer to log into a new account, selecting 'n' proceeds to a new Telegram login. The default method is to log in by scanning a QR Code screenshot and moving to step 6.
     - Should this method be unsuccessful, or if another method is preferred, follow the OTP login procedure outlined in steps 4 and 5.

4. **Country Name and Phone Number for Telegram:**
   - Enter your Country Name as displayed on Telegram's login page or accept the default, which is auto-detected based on your IP.

5. **One-Time Password (OTP):**
   - Enter the OTP sent to your registered Telegram account.

6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - If 2FA is enabled on your Telegram account, enter your 2FA password following the QR code scan or OTP entry.

7. **Seed Phrase Input for HereWalletBot Login:**
   - Carefully input your 12-word seed phrase, ensuring correct spacing without any punctuation or numbers.

8. **Exit & Resume Options:**
   - Opt to exit and save the session for later resumption, possibly using PM2, or continue with claims directly in the CLI script.


Remember to check and adjust your settings upon startup to optimize the script's performance to your server's capabilities.

After following these steps, if all inputs are correctly entered, and assuming no flooding block is in place, you'll successfully logged into both Telegram and HereWallet.

# Security Considerations for HotWalletClaimer Usage

üí° Communication: The only external communication is with the Telegram Web App, which occurs over HTTPS, providing a secure channel.

‚ö†Ô∏è Your seed phrase and Telegram login details are not stored or transmitted by this script, except during the unavoidable one-time login process with https://web.telegram.org/k/#@herewalletbot. As of version v1.3.4, the Google Chrome session is now saved into the ```./HotWalletBot/selenium``` folder and in v.1.3.6 there is also a duplicate of the session in ```./HotWalletBot/backups``` - if this information was compromised, it would allow a suitably experienced individual to access your account.  

üí° Debugging: Enabling debug mode captures the whole process as screenshots, excluding the seed phrase entry step. These images are stored locally to assist you in the event of errors and are not otherwise transmitted or uploaded in any way.

## Security Best Practice:

üí° Private Devices: Only use this script on private, secure machines or Virtual Private Servers that only you can access.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution with Seed Phrases: Be very cautious with accounts of significant value. Consider the effect of any unintended loss should your seed phrase become compromised.

üí° Awareness and Discretion: Understand the security trade-offs of using this automation tool or any other third-party tools. Your vigilance is crucial in safeguarding your information.

## Disclaimer:
Use of HotWalletClaimer is at your own risk. While we are confident that the script neither transmits nor stores your sensitive data, it is essential to acknowledge that devices can become compromised through viruses or other malicious software. The developers of HotWalletClaimer exclude any liability for potential security breaches or financial losses. It is your responsibility to safeguard your digital security. Always prioritize protecting your accounts and sensitive information.
